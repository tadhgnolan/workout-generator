---
Workout Generator is a bodybuilding/aesthetic focused physical fitness app designed to give experienced users a randomly generated workout to make the process of exercise selection for each training cycle easier. 

Progressive overload is a core principle of bodybuilding and many other forms of physical training. In layman's terms an individual will adapt to any form of consistent training over time, therefore it’s necessary to adjust training variables such as load (weight), volume (work done) & exercise selection periodically, in some cases every 6 - 8 weeks.

This app aims to simplify that process by randomly selecting exercises for each muscle group from a database for the user.

## UX
An Agile methodology was used in planning the project utilising Github's Project 
kanban. Issues were used to create user stories. When work began on a user story, it was moved to the "In Progress" column. When the task is complete, it is marked as closed. Labels were used to mark priority of issue. Milestones were used to set major project objectives. A column named “Could Have” is used for prospective features for the website and for any features that were not complete by the project deadline.

### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-fffdd0-ffc107-28a745-007bff-555555-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

### Donate App

- `Donation` Model

```python
class Donation(models.Model):
    order_number = models.CharField(max_length=2555, unique=True)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=254, null=False, blank=False)
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, default=5.00) # €5 fixed amount
    stripe_product_id = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True) # Store Stripe Product ID
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### Generator App

- `Workout` Model

```python
class Workout(models.Model):
    """
    The body part for the workout: eg: legs, shoulders, arms, back, chest, core
    """
    BODY_PARTS = (
        (0, "legs"),
        (1, "arms"),
        (2, "chest"),
        (3, "shoulders"),
        (4, "back"),
    )

    name = models.CharField(max_length=75, null=False, blank=False)
    body_part = models.IntegerField(choices=BODY_PARTS, default=0)
```

- `Exercise` Model

```python
class Exercise(models.Model):
    """
    The exercise that would be generated at random each time.
    """
    workout = models.ForeignKey(Workout, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=False, blank=False)
    wiki_link = models.URLField(max_length=256, null=False, blank=False)
    sets = models.PositiveIntegerField(
        default=3,
        validators=[MinValueValidator(3), MaxValueValidator(6)],
        null=False, blank=False)
    reps = models.PositiveIntegerField(
        default=12,
        validators=[MinValueValidator(12), MaxValueValidator(20)],
        null=False, blank=False)
    muscle_focus = models.CharField(max_length=50, null=False, blank=False)
    description = models.TextField(null=False, blank=False)
```

### Newsletter App

- `Newsletter` Model

```python
class Newsletter(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=256, null=False, blank=False)
```

### ERD

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/tadhgnolan/workout-generator/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tadhgnolan/workout-generator/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.


- [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tadhgnolan/workout-generator)](https://github.com/tadhgnolan/workout-generator/issues)

- [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/tadhgnolan/workout-generator)](https://github.com/tadhgnolan/workout-generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model.
It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything
such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers,
especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users.
For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock,
updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users
when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine.
This included a series of the following keyword types

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

I also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit
to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file.
This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://workout-generator-43e8f8387f8d.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a
[sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml) which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level.
Inside, I've included the default settings:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://workout-generator-43e8f8387f8d.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

Further links for future implementation:
- [Google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [Creating and submitting a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
- [Managing your sitemaps and using sitemaps reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001)
- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales.
Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

I've created a placeholder Facebook business account on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61559076988919).

![screenshot](documentation/placeholder-facebook.png)

#### External Links

For pages that open in a new tab, I've used the `target="_blank"` and `rel="nofollow noreferrer"` attributes.

- View Wiki Page for Workout

```html
<!-- external link to wiki page -->
<a href="{{ exercise.wiki_link }}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer" class="btn btn-light m-1">View Exercise</a>
```

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporated a newsletter sign-up form on my application made using a custom Django model, to allow users to supply their
email address if they are interested in learning more.

- `Newsletter` Model

```python
class Newsletter(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=256, null=False, blank=False)
```


## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://workout-generator-43e8f8387f8d.herokuapp.com).

### Whitenoise

This project uses WhiteNoise to handle static files for the deployed site on Heroku. There aren't any requirements for user-uploaded files/images, so it wasn't necessary to use something like AWS-S3 or Cloudinary.

- `pip3 install whitenoise`

`settings.py`
```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://workout-generator-43e8f8387f8d.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.18`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`

## User Story Testing

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

## Unfixed Bugs

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.
